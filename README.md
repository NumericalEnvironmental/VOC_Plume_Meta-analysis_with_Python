# VOC_Plume_Meta-analysis_with_Python

![Preview](https://numericalenvironmental.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/cal_general_map.jpeg?w=655&h=463)

This is a python script I have written to read and parse a large groundwater quality database (thousands of wells, with hundreds of thousands of sample events) into individual groundwater plumes, subject to subsequent spatial analyses to develop a simple set of plume metrics. A more detailed description and some example results are provided in my blog:

https://numericalenvironmental.wordpress.com/2017/04/17/meta-analysis-of-over-1000-groundwater-chlorinated-hydrocarbon-plumes-using-python-tools/

The required python 2.7-compatible libraries required to run this script include:
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* pyproj
* scipy
* seaborn

In addition, the following input files are needed:

* gama_df.csv: a comma-delimited text file which is an already-produced extraction of chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) data from Californiaâ€™s Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment (GAMA) database, if this option is selected when the code is run. Otherwise, tab-delimited text files for complete data from all 50+ California counties is required (several GB worth of data, so not provided here). If this latter option is selected, the gama_df.csv file will be created automatically for subsequent runs.

* analytes.txt: a text file listing the CVOCs of interest to read from the database (naming must be consistent with what is used in GAMA).

* counties.txt: a text file listing the names of individual tab-delimited text files corresponding to California counties, as represented in GAMA. This file is required regardless of whether data are read from gama_df.csv summary file or not.
